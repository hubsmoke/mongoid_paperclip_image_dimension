= mongoid_paperclip_image_dimension

This is a simple gem to persist image dimensions of originals and thumbnails for mongoid documents.
It works for both s3 and filesystem storages.
This lib is based on this article: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4065295/paperclip-saving-the-images-dimentions-width-height

== Installation

You can simply install from rubygems:

  gem install mongoid_paperclip_image_dimension

or in Gemfile:

  gem 'mongoid_paperclip_image_dimension'
  
== Basic Usage

  class Post
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Paperclip
    include Mongoid::Paperclip::ImageDimension
    
    has_mongoid_attached_file :image, :styles => {
      :large    =>    ['350x350>',     :jpg],
      :medium   =>    ['150x150>',     :jpg],
      :small    =>    ['30x30>',       :jpg]
    }
    
    has_mongoid_attached_file :another_image, :styles => {
      :large    =>    ['350x350>',     :jpg],
      :medium   =>    ['150x150>',     :jpg],
      :small    =>    ['30x30>',       :jpg]
    }
    
    # This will save all dimensions of images and thumbnails for both :image and :another_image
    save_image_dimensions_on :image, :another_image
  end
  
  # retrieve image dimensions
  p = Post.first
  p.image_dimensions    # If the original image has width of 2048 and height of 1024, the output should be:
                        #   {
                        #     'original' => [2048, 1024],
                        #     'large'    => [350, 175],
                        #     'medium'   => [150, 75],
                        #     'small'    => [30, 15]
                        #   }
                        
  p.another_image_dimensions    # If the original image has width of 2048 and height of 1024, the output should be:
                                #   {
                                #     'original' => [2048, 1024],
                                #     'large'    => [350, 175],
                                #     'medium'   => [150, 75],
                                #     'small'    => [30, 15]
                                #   }
  }
  
  # some sugar:
  p.image_dimension               # [2048, 1024]
  p.image_dimension(:original)    # [2048, 1024]
  p.image_dimension(:large)       # [350, 175]
  
  p.image_dimension_str             # "2048x1024"
  p.image_dimension_str(:original)  # "2048x1024"
  p.image_dimension_str(:large)     # "350x175"
